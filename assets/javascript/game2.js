// 3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

// 6. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

//    * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

//    * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

// 7. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

// 8. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

// 9. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.


// list of words to guess
// list of alphabet letters
// number of times a user can guess before end of game
// list letters guessed so far
// document to innerHTML for each field which needs to pull in value: i.e. win, loss, letters, guesses left
// function for user input on keyboard
// figure out to get to uppercase
//need to hide the word until the letters are guessed
// need to replace the empty space when correct letter is guessed 
// once reach maximum number of guesses report loss  or once successful  
    // add tally to losses or wins
    // reset for a new word
// because we have full words, need to create for loops to check each letter in the array vs just one letter match up
